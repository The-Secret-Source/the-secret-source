# **App Name**: Echo Artist Discovery

## Core Features:

- Artist Randomization: Artist Randomizer: Uses an AI tool to fetch a random artist from a curated list of open-source music datasets. It attempts to prioritize artists who may benefit from additional exposure, considering factors like obscurity and number of streams.
- Artist Profile Presentation: Artist Display: Showcases the selected artist's name, a brief bio (sourced from available data), and links to their music profiles. Allows embedding music when possible
- Support the Artist CTA: Bandcamp Button: Provides a prominent button to support the artist via Bandcamp or other platforms of choice to buy their albums or tracks.
- Dataset Management: Open Data Curation: Keep an updated curated dataset of artists who are included in open-source datasets, that the LLM uses as a tool to fetch information about artists to show.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 50%, 50% (RGB: #4080BF) - A calming blue suggesting open access and a feeling of 'discovery'.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (RGB: #F0F2F5) - A light, desaturated blue for a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 60%, 40% (RGB: #29A699) - A vibrant cyan for call-to-action elements, providing a contrasting visual pop.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for a modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent music platforms (Bandcamp, Spotify, etc.) and social media links.
- Clean, card-based layout for presenting artist information, with a focus on readability and easy navigation.
- Subtle fade-in animations when loading new artist profiles, for a smooth user experience.
